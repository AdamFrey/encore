# Setup

Add the [relevant dependency](../#latest-releases) to your project:

```clojure
Leiningen: [com.taoensso/encore               "x-y-z"] ; or
deps.edn:   com.taoensso/encore {:mvn/version "x-y-z"}
```

And setup your namespace imports:

```clojure
(ns my-app (:require [taoensso.encore :as enc]))
```

# Usage

Encore is currently **undocumented** since it's intended mostly for my own use, or for advanced users who are comfortable reading the source code and commit history for more info. Apologies!
