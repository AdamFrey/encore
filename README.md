# Encore

## Core utils library for Clojure/Script

**Or**: What happens when you spend way too much time with Clojure.

**Please note**: this library is intended mostly for my own use or for **advanced users** who are comfortable reading the source code to see what's available + how to use it.

## Latest release/s

Please check [Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.taoensso/encore) for details.
