> This is a library intended for my own use, and for advanced users who are comfortable reading the source code to see what's available + how to use it.

# Cross-platform Clojure utils library

  * See the [source][] to see what's available (no docs on this one, sorry).
  * Used as a shared support library for the [taoensso Clojure libs][].

## Contact & contributing

`lein start-dev` to get a (headless) development repl that you can connect to with [Cider][] (emacs) or your IDE.

Please use the project's GitHub [issues page][] for project questions/comments/suggestions/whatever **(pull requests welcome!)**. Am very open to ideas if you have any!

Otherwise reach me (Peter Taoussanis) at [taoensso.com][] or on [Twitter][]. Cheers!
